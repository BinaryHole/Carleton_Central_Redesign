/**
 GLOBAL CSS GOES HERE 

 Use this file for selector reference (Classes/Id's)

 For example, when creating a button, set the button's class/id to what is specified in this file
    so that it will inherit the global style

 For Selector Reference: https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_selectors.asp
    
    Classes are selected with a period. For example:

        .red_button {
            color: red;
        }

    ID's are selected with pound. For example:

        #red_button {
            color: red;
        }
